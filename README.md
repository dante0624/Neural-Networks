# Neural-Networks
Following the free online book by Michael Nielsen

Much of the code from this book was specifically written for python 2, so I have made some changes of my own to make the code work in python 3

This repository is largely devoted to my own learning of Neural-Networks, so I have also included a paper that I wrote about this topic for a class which explains neural networks based on my current understanding of them.
